# Dev Team Standup at CSE110

We've been doing engineering stand-ups for as long as there has been an engineering team. The format has changed
over time as the size and scope of Artsy has changed. We're now on our fourth iteration of this process, which you
can standup_blog.

The current on-call engineers run standup. On-call rotations are staggered so an engineer starting on a Monday will
team up with the engineer that started the preceding Wednesday. **Pick one person to do the talking parts
(facilitate the meeting) and one person to take notes**.

### Ten minutes before a standup

The person handling the talking parts does this stuff ten minutes before standup:

- `@here`s the dev channel. Include where the meeting is in the UCSD office (usually petersn hall).
- Make sure on-call staff are prepared to give an update about the past week's incidents. (if you were on call,
  great! If you weren't, remind your partner.)
- Check the schedule.
- The meeting starts with props and you should begin with giving props of your own.

### During standup

**Important**: Make sure the person taking notes doesn't have their laptop next to the Zoom speakerphone.

The person who is facilitating the meeting should use the template below as an agenda.
